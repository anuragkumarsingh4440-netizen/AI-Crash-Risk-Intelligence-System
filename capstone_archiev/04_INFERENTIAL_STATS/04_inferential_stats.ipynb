This strongly supports the claim that **higher speed environments are associated with more severe injuries**, validating the EDA insight with formal statistical evidence.\n","\n","- **Light Condition:**  \n","  Light condition is also significantly associated with injury severity (χ² = 217.15, *p* < 0.001). This suggests that **visibility conditions** (e.g., daylight vs. dark) influence crash severity outcomes, reinforcing the role of environmental factors in determining crash impact.\n","\n","- **Collision Type:**  \n","  Collision type exhibits the **strongest association** with injury severity (χ² = 8196.99, *p* < 0.001), highlighting that the **nature of the collision** (rear-end, head-on, sideswipe, etc.) is a critical determinant of injury outcomes. This aligns with real-world crash dynamics and adds strong causal plausibility to downstream predictive modeling.\n","\n","**Overall Conclusion:**  \n","These results confirm that injury severity is **not independent** of speed, lighting, or collision mechanics. The findings strengthen both the **statistical credibility** and **domain validity** of the capstone analysis, moving beyond surface-level EDA and model accuracy to demonstrate robust inferential support.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jLQU0-Vw-YcK"},"id":"jLQU0-Vw-YcK"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Q2.
